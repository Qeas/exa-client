This README file contains the instructions on how to use exa_client_deploy.py to build/configure/remove A3I client software packages on a DGX server.

Prerequisites and Limitations:
1) Only one instance of the script can be run at a time.
2) The script needs python3 to run.
3) The script needs to be run as root.
4) The script and the source bundled in A3I client software package is tested with 4.15.0-x, 5.3.0-x & 5.4.0-x kernel versions. The script may or may not work for other kernel versions. Contact DDN support if you have a kernel different from those mentioned above.

Here are some sample examples of the script run -

1) Checking if A3I client software is installed or not -

# ./exa_client_deploy.py

DDN A3I client software installation tool: Version 6.0.0
Select an option:

1) Check if DDN A3I client software is installed
2) Install DDN A3I client software
3) Configure DDN A3I client software
4) Remove DDN A3I client software
5) Exit
1

A3I client software packages are not installed

2) Installing A3I client software -

# ./exa_client_deploy.py 

DDN A3I client software installation tool: Version 6.0.0
Select an option:

1) Check if DDN A3I client software is installed
2) Install DDN A3I client software
3) Configure DDN A3I client software
4) Remove DDN A3I client software
5) Exit
2
Enter path to lustre source (leave empty to use default source):

A3I client software packages are installed and placed in /opt/ddn/exascaler/rpms folder
Use option 3 to configure A3I client software before loading lustre module

3) Configuring A3I client software - 
This step needs user to specify LNets (Semicolon separated) in following format -
<LNet>(comma separated interface list);<Lnet>(comma separated interface list)
e.g. o2ib0(ib0,ib1);o2ib1(ib2,ib3)

# ./exa_client_deploy.py 

DDN A3I client software installation tool: Version 6.0.0
Select an option:

1) Check if DDN A3I client software is installed
2) Install DDN A3I client software
3) Configure DDN A3I client software
4) Remove DDN A3I client software
5) Exit
3
Specify LNets (semicolon separated) - default [o2ib(ib0,ib1)]:
Specify cpu_npartitions - default [20]:

A3I client software is configured

Load the lustre module once configuration is done.

# modprobe lustre

Mount the lustre filesystem on the client.

E.g. -
# mount -t lustre 172.60.0.16@o2ib:/fs0a9c /mnt/ai400x/


After the filesystem is mounted, the tune_lustre.sh script bundled in the client package can be used to boost performance.

# ./tune_lustre.sh


The exa_client_deploy.py script can also be used to deploy/configure A3I client software in a single command -

# ./exa_client_deploy.py --install --lnets "o2ib0(ib0,ib1,ib2,ib3)" --npartitions 20
